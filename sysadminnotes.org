#+TITLE: Sysadmin

* What does a sysadmin do?
  - Install, operate, and maintain client and server OSes
    - Network config
    - Configure DNS, DHCP, Active Directory, Update
    - Troubleshoot
    - Automate, document, configure
    - Take notes and repeate something that works
  - Secure a system and prevent 0 days
  - O&M. When something comes out, you have to go and fix it ASAP
* Week 1 Architecture:
  - StudentX -> fw01-studentX -> SYS255-WAN -> fw-sys255 -> CYBER -> "internet"
  - WAN: Wide Area Network
    - You need a unique WAN IP address. Shared WAN IP addresses will not work together
  - LAN: Local Area Network
  - Lab Scope: Turn on firewall, connect things, set up static IPs, make sure things connect

* Lab 1 Notes
** Configuring PfSense
   PfSense: A firewall distribution of FreeBSD that is made for the purpose of being installed on a router or firewall. It's default password is admin/pfsense
  1. [X] The first step is to configure the virtual machine itself. We have to network it to the other machines in our virtual network.
     * Right click on the machine in vsphere and modify the network adapters to work on the specified WAN. In our case, Network adapter 1 is going to connect out to the WAN and the second connects to our LAN. 
  2. [X] Restart the machine
  3. [X] Assign Interfaces
     * The WAN, by default, is using DHCP to give itself an IP address. We don't want this as we have a specified IP assigned to us. We'll want to change this.
     * We need to assign WAN to em0 and LAN to em1. This is done through the 1 option and going through the wizard. Don't assign VLANs.
  4. [X] Set IPs to the Interfaces
     * Select 2 to enter the wizard. We want to remove DHCP from WAN and LAN as want to use static addressing for out set up.
     * We are using /24, ipv4, and no HTTP
     * Do the same for LAN but the assigned IP is 10.0.5.2
     * The firewall is now configured and we now want to move to windows to connect to the firewall.
** Configuring Windows for PfSense
   Windows will use our PfSense instance as it's router and firewall. We want to configure the machine to connect to the router. We also want to make a new admin account and give it a new hostname.
  1. [X] Make a new hostname
     * To do this enter Settings -> System -> About -> Rename this PC
     * Restart
  2. [X] Make a local admin
     * Open control panel and go into User Accounts. 
     * Manage another account and create a new account.
     * Add someone else to the PC and name them whatever.
     * Make the user an admin
     * Delete the champ account.
  3. [X] Configure the network
     * Set VM settings to connect the Network Adapter to the LAN.
     * Restart
     * Enter control panel -> Network and Internet
     * Sharing Center -> Ethernet0 -> Properties
     * Here we can go into the properties of IPv4
     * We'll want to set the gateway to 10.0.5.2 and our IP to 10.0.5.100. Subnet mask is what you think it is. Our DNS is the same as the gateway.
     * Make sure to set the upstream gateway to 10.0.17.2. This fucked me for about an hour lmao.
  4. [X] Finish configuring the firewall from the web browser
     * Connect to our firewall in the browser (10.0.5.2)
     * Login with the admin and the default password
     * Press next to go through the wizard. 
       * Change things and uncheck "block private networks"
