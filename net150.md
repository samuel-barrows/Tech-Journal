Week 1:
  * On windows machines, you can view your computers network information by typing 'ipconfig /all' into a command prompt. This will give you 
  information on your MAC address, Gateway, Subnet Mask, IP addresses, all of this on your different NICs. 
  
  * Booting Kali
    * To change the boot order on the Foster Lab computers, you restart the computer while hitting the 'Delete'. This will bring up the
    BIOS menu. Here, you can move over to the Boot tab. Hit the arrow keys to navigate down to the drive you would like to boot first, hit 
    enter and then move it up to the top spot. This is useful for booting into a USB drive, or just changing the boot order if you have a new
    one. 
    * Once you have the booted into Kali, you can hit enter on the Live option. This will allow you to use Kali without installing it on the
    hardware.
    
Week 2:
  * On Linux, you can type "ip route show" to show information on your network connection. This includes the default gateway. 
  * Running a scan on Wireshark while pinging a machine will show you both the MAC address for your machine and the MAC of the target.

Week 3: 
  * Wireshark will capture ARP requests.
  * Running "netsh interface ip delete arpcache" on a Windows machine will whipe the ARP tables saved on your computer.
  * To open a command prompt as Administrator in windows, type cmd in the search bar, right click cmd and click "Run as Administrator"
  * Running "macchanger -m xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx device" with xx... being a different MAC address and device being the device you want to change
    on Kali will spoof a MAC address on whatever device you change it on.
  
Week 4: 
  * Packet Tracer is a program used to simulate networks using simulated CISCO hardware. This is useful for creating a network and seeing     how
    it will be configured and set up before you actually build it in the real world. 
  * Simulation mode in Packet Tracer is a way to run your simulation in a step-by-step way. Generally, Packet Tracer is run in real time, 
    so simulation mode is a good way to see how your network works. Clicking simulation mode in the bottom right will switch you to said 
    mode. You can click through the steps manually and watch the packets move around the network. This is useful for troubleshooting as 
    well.
    
Week 5:
  * The edge router is a mini router/switch combo. Connecting it is as simple as plugging it in and then plugging the computers' ethernet
    cables into the ports. One should be plugged into the first port so it can manage the router on the web interface.
  * The interfaces of the router were configured in the web interface. You can click on each of the ports and assign it a gateway and 
    IP address.
    
Week 6:
 * Subnetting is dividing up a network into different networks of different sizes. 
 * This is done using the logical address and must be thought about in terms of the binary equivalent.
 * Let's say you had 192.168.20.0/24 network. The subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. This is equivalent to f.f.f.0. 
   * A /24 network only has 256 available host IPs as the last octet represents the number of host addresses. 
   * A /23 network, subnet mask of 255.255.254.0, has double the host addresses because the subnet mask is now f.f.11111110.0.

Week 8:
  * tracert on Windows and traceroute on Unix like systems is a good way to troubleshoot connection issues
  * Counts hops, hops being each router between the source and the destination

Week 9:
  * Static routes can be created using this series of commands on a router:
    * enable
    * config terminal
    * ip route DESTINATION-IP SUBNET-MASK NEXT-HOP 
  * Enter as many routes as you need to be configured for each router
  * Outside of config mode, you can see the Routing Table by typing 'show ip route'

Week 10: 
  * Dynamic Routing can be configured using RIPv2
  * On a router, enter config mode (enable, config terminal)
  * type router rip
  * version 2
  * then type in the networks that are DIRECTLY CONNECTED to that router.
  * network 192.168.30.0 if that network is *directly connected* to it.
  * Do this for all of the routers on the network.
  * If you check the routing table ('show ip route' outside of config mode) you can verify that the routes have been configured.
  
Week 11:
 * To create a VLAN on a switch, enter the config tab on the switch and enter the VLAN database.
 * From here, you simply add the VLAN number and name to the database
 * You can enable each VLAN on each port by entering that port and simply changing the VLAN number.
 * To connect the VLANs across switches, you have to enable the Trunk ports.
 * On the port that the switches are connected on (should be the gigabit one), change the Access to Trunk and then check the newly added VLANs.
   * Doing this on all ports that switches are connected on will allow full connectivity for the VLANs, except when crossing the VLANs, you need a router for that.
  
 * To interconnect the VLANs, you need to set up a router
 * On one of the switches, change a FastEthernet port to Trunk
 * In the CLI, type 'config terminal' and then 'interface FASTETHERNET-PORT'
 * Once you are there, type in 'switchport trunk native vlan VLAN#'
 * 'switchport nonegotiate'
 * Now, if all the VLANs were set up prior to this, all of the VLANs should be able to ping one another.
 
Week 12:
 * Configuring a wireless Router in Packet Tracer:
   * Go into the GUI tab on a wireless router
   * Set the static IP of the router to the internet address of the router.
   * Set the router IP to the LAN address of the router.
   * Enable DHCP
   * Save Settings
   * Click into the wireless tab at the top of the GUI.
     * Here you can set the standard to Wireless-N only and then change the SSID
     * Disable SSID Broadcast and save settings
     * Click into wireless security and swith to WPA2 Personal
     * Change the PSK and save settings
 * Configure a Wireless Client
   * Click into the device's Desktop tab and go to PC Wireless
   * Go to the Profiles tab and click New to create a new profile
   * Click Advanced Setup, leave Infrastruture Mode and type your router's SSID in.
   * Leave DHCP on
   * Change security to WPA2-Personal and type in the PSK
   * Click Save Settings and Connect to the Network
 * Connect Wired Router and Web Server to Wireless Router
   * Connect the Wireless Router to the Wired Router using a crossover cable
   * Connect the wired router with the web server using a crossover cable
   * Server Reset Connection Error:
     * I ran into this error when configuring the wired router. Here I set the Default Gateway for the web server to the IP of    the webserver itself. This gave the error "Server Reset Connection" in the web browsers of the laptops. I fixed it by changing the IP of the default gateway to the correct one.
